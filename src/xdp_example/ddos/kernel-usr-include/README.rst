kernel-usr-include
==================

This directory kernel-usr-include, contains a copy of (some of the
files from) that gets generated by the kernel via ::

  make headers_install

The make target headers_install, will install sanitised kernel headers
to INSTALL_HDR_PATH (default into kernel rootdir under usr/).

These files should also be shipped with the distro, e.g. via package
kernel-headers (Fedora).  But we cannot depend on the distro shipping
a new enough header file. Thus, we keep a copy that it known to work
with eBPF programs in this git-repo. These are primarily used when
compiling the userspace programs.
